    	<p>I have been working with a start-up called Haul Innovations started by my friend Usha Kiran. We organize skill development workshops based on Automobiles to engineering students of different streams. We also started working on developing marketing strategies for companies whose target audiences are college students. Though the company has been officially stated only 3 months ago, I have been working with them since February 2017.   </p>

	<p><b>NAME OF THE PROJECT:</b>EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF UNSTEADY STATE HEAT       TRANSFER IN CONDENSOR WITH MIXED REFRIGERANTS WITH MIXED REFRIGERANTS R290 AND R600a</p>
    <p><b>Description               :    </b>It was reported in the literature that the use of mixed refrigerants in refrigeration systems can enhance the performance of the refrigerators. Hence, in the present work, two refrigerants are chosen (R-290 and R-600a) to evaluate the performance of domestic refrigerators. The refrigeration cycle consists of four major processes. The isentropic compression in the compressor, isobaric heat rejection in the condensor, isenthalpic reduction in pressure and isobaric heat addition in the evaporator.
	The present work aims at investigation of unsteady state heat transfer in the condensor with mixed refrigerants (R-290 and R-600a). The reduction in temperature of the refrigerant with time is experimentally investigated. </p>
	<h4><b>Internships:</b></h4>
	<p>•	I had done my internship on Mechatronics in Birmingham City University In Birmingham in United Kingdom. </p>
	<p>•	I had also completed a summer training programme on Design and Manufacturing ATV/Quad bike conducted by Fraternity of Mechanical and Automotive Engineers in the year 2014. </p>
